            <p> Hi I'm <b>Jerome James O. Senajon</b>, a student of </br>
                 University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines </br>
                 with the course of <i>BS - Technology Communication Management</i>. </br>I chose USTP because I want to graduate 
                 from a school </br>that is well known for its excellence and ability </br>
                 to produce individuals that contributes greatly to society and technology. I have a passion for playing instruments like </br>the Piano and Guitar. </br></br> The course of life is full of ups and downs. </br>
                If today is not good for us, then we must keep hope that </br>everything will be good very soon.
                 We must never </br>discourage ourselves during tough times. </br>Therefore, In life always try to appreciate your living. </br>
                  Find your purpose and strive to be more helpful each </br>day.
